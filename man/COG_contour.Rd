\title{Compute Contour-Based Center of Gravity (COG) from Convex Polygon}
\usage{
COG_contour(img, origin = c("bottomleft", "topleft"))
}
\arguments{
\item{img}{An image input, either a file path to an image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG),
or a \code{cimg} object from the \pkg{imager} package. The image should be in binary form,
with foreground (glyph) values not equal to 1 and background values equal to 1.}

\item{origin}{A character string indicating the location of the image origin.
Use \code{"bottomleft"} (default) if the y-axis increases upward (Cartesian),
or \code{"topleft"} if the y-axis increases downward (as in image arrays).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{\code{statistics}}{A data frame with computed center coordinates (original, trimmed, and standardized),
margins around the glyph, and original image dimensions. The center is calculated as the centroid of the
smallest convex polygon enclosing the glyph region.}
\item{\code{points}}{A data frame of (x, y) coordinates representing the contour points of the convex polygon.}
}
}
\description{
Calculates the center of gravity (COG) of a character-like binary image based on its outer contour.
This function implements the method proposed by Kotani and colleagues (2004, 2011), in which the COG
is computed as the geometric center of the smallest convex polygon (convex hull) that encloses the
character region. The outer contour is traced counterclockwise starting from the bottommost-leftmost pixel,
and the resulting closed shape is filled to compute its centroid.
