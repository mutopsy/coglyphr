\title{Compute Potential Energy-Based Center of Gravity (COG)}
\usage{
COG_potential(img, origin = c("bottomleft", "topleft"))
}
\arguments{
\item{img}{An image input, either a file path to an image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG),
or a \code{cimg} object from the \pkg{imager} package. The image should be in binary form,
with foreground (glyph) values not equal to 1 and background values equal to 1.}

\item{origin}{A character string indicating the location of the image origin.
Use \code{"bottomleft"} (default) if the y-axis increases upward (Cartesian),
or \code{"topleft"} if the y-axis increases downward (as in image arrays).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{\code{statistics}}{A data frame with computed center coordinates (original, trimmed, and standardized),
margins around the glyph, and original image dimensions. The center is calculated as the centroid of the
smallest convex polygon enclosing the glyph region.}
\item{\code{potentials}}{A data frame containing the (x, y) coordinates and the normalized potential value
for each pixel within the convex hull. The potentials are normalized so that their sum equals 1.}
}
}
\description{
Calculates the center of gravity (COG) of a character-like binary image based on potential energy.
This function implements the method proposed by Kotani et al. (2006), in which the COG is defined
as the potential energy-weighted mean within the smallest convex polygon (i.e., convex hull)
that encloses the character region. Each pixel in the stroke region is treated as a point mass of unit mass.
The potential at each pixel is computed as the sum of the inverses of the distances between that pixel
and all pixels in the stroke region.
