Description: Computes the center of gravity (COG) of character-like binary images using three different methods. This package provides functions for estimating stroke-based, contour-based, and potential energy-based COG. It is useful for analyzing glyph structure in areas such as visual cognition research and font development. The contour-based method was originally proposed by Kotani et al. (2004) <https://ipsj.ixsq.nii.ac.jp/records/36793> and Kotani (2011) <https://shonan-it.repo.nii.ac.jp/records/2000243>, while the potential energy-based method was introduced by Kotani et al. (2006) <doi:10.11371/iieej.35.296>.
